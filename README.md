### Data Engineer, Category and Partner Management Leader

Experienced in smart home, IoT, consumer electronics, retail category management, and end-to-end P&L management. Excited to leverage my years of processing, analyzing and leveraging data, coupled with my technical skills (ETL construction, Python, SQL, Airflow, Spark, BigQuery, dbt, Looker, etc), to drive results in data engineering.

Based in southern California and attended UCLA (Go Bruins!). I have a passion for soccer and I am technology-obsessed (creating the ultimate smart home is a hobby of mine).
